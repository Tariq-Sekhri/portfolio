    "readme": "# Time Tracker Demo\n\nA **web demo** of [Time Tracker](https://github.com/Tariq-Sekhri/time_tracker)—so you can see what the app looks like and try the UI without installing anything. Deployed on the web for easy sharing.\n\n## What This Is\n\n- **Demo only**: Uses mock data. No real time tracking, no desktop integration.\n- **Web app**: Runs in the browser. Built for deployment on the web (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).\n- **Preview**: Shows the calendar, statistics, categories, and layout of the full Time Tracker product.\n\nThe real Time Tracker is a private, automatic desktop app (Tauri + Rust) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. This repo is just the demo frontend.\n\n## Features (Demo)\n\n- **Calendar view**: Week/day views with sample time blocks\n- **Statistics**: Mock usage stats and donut charts\n- **Categories & rules**: UI for categories and regex-based rules\n- **Skipped apps**: UI for configuring skipped applications\n- **Google Calendar-style events**: Sample events in time blocks\n\nAll data is fake and in-memory; refreshing the page resets it.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **React 19** + **TypeScript**\n- **Vite 7**\n- **Tailwind CSS 4**\n- **FullCalendar** (day/week grid)\n- **TanStack Query** + **Zustand**\n- **Tauri APIs** (optional; used when running inside the full desktop app)\n\n## Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v18+)\n\n### Run locally\n\n```bash\ngit clone <this-repo>\ncd \"time tracker demo\"\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:1420](http://localhost:1420) (or the port Vite prints).\n\n### Build for production (web deployment)\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nDeploy the `dist/` folder to any static host, e.g.:\n\n- **Vercel**: `vercel` or connect the repo\n- **Netlify**: Drag `dist` to Netlify or connect the repo and set build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`\n- **GitHub Pages**: This repo includes a workflow that builds and deploys on every push to `main` (see below).\n\n### Deploy to GitHub Pages (included workflow)\n\n1. **One-time setup**: In your repo on GitHub go to **Settings → Pages**. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.\n2. Push your code to the `main` branch. The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) will run: it installs deps, runs `npm run build`, and deploys the `dist/` folder.\n3. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (replace with your GitHub username and repo name).\n\nYou can also run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab → **Deploy to GitHub Pages** → **Run workflow**.\n\n### Preview production build locally\n\n```bash\nnpm run preview\n```\n\n## License\n\nPolyform Noncommercial 1.0.

    "readme": "# Time Tracker\n\nPrivate, automatic desktop time tracking for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 100% local. No cloud. No telemetry.\n\n## Why\n\nManual time tracking is tedious and inconsistent. Time Tracker runs in the background and logs your active window usage automatically so you can see where your time goes.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Automatic tracking**: Monitors foreground window every second and logs active application usage\n- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (X11 only for Linux)\n- **System tray integration**: Runs in the background with system tray icon; window can be hidden to tray\n- **Local storage**: SQLite database stored locally (platform-specific paths)\n- **Skipped apps with regex**: Use regex patterns to skip tracking specific apps (e.g., `^Chrome$` for exact match or `.*Discord.*` for partial match)\n- **Categorization system**: Categories and regex-based rules for organizing tracked time\n- **API endpoints**: Query logs, categories, and category regex rules via Tauri commands\n- **Background process**: Continuous monitoring that aggregates duration for the same application\n\n## Privacy\n\n- All data is stored locally on your machine:\n  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/time-tracker/app.db`\n  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/time-tracker/app.db`\n  - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/time-tracker/app.db`\n- No cloud, no telemetry, no third‑party services\n- Offline by design. The app does not make network requests\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Tauri 2**: Rust backend with system WebView\n- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript\n- **Database**: SQLite via `sqlx` (bundled, runtime-tokio-rustls)\n- **Platform-specific APIs**:\n  - **Windows**: `windows` crate for foreground window detection\n  - **macOS**: `objc` crate for NSWorkspace API\n  - **Linux**: `x11` crate for X11 window management (X11 only, Wayland not supported)\n- **Time handling**: `chrono` for timestamp formatting\n- **Async runtime**: Tokio for background process\n- **Regex**: Pattern matching for skipped apps and category rules\n\n## Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js and npm\n- Rust and Cargo\n- Platform-specific requirements:\n  - **Windows**: No additional requirements\n  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (for building)\n  - **Linux**: X11 development libraries (for X11 support)\n    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev`\n    - Fedora: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel`\n    - Arch: `sudo pacman -S libx11`\n\n### Development\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Tariq-Sekhri/time_tracker\ncd time_tracker\nnpm install\nnpm run tauri dev\n```\n\n### Build\n\n```bash\nnpm run tauri build\n```\n\nBuilds use SQLx **offline mode** (the `.sqlx/` cache in `src-tauri/`). No database is required at compile time. If you change Rust SQL queries, regenerate the cache:\n\n```bash\ncd src-tauri\n# Use the real app DB (ensure the app has been run at least once)\n$env:DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:C:/Users/<you>/AppData/Roaming/time-tracker/app.db\"   # Windows PowerShell\n# DATABASE_URL=\"sqlite:$HOME/Library/Application Support/time-tracker/app.db\"      # macOS\n# DATABASE_URL=\"sqlite:$HOME/.local/share/time-tracker/app.db\"                     # Linux\ncargo sqlx prepare\n```\n\nCommit updated `.sqlx/` after running `sqlx prepare`. For CI or builds without a DB, set `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` when running `cargo build` (Tauri build does not need it if `DATABASE_URL` is unset).\n\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n\n### Windows\n- Fully supported with native Windows API\n- No additional configuration required\n\n### macOS\n- Requires accessibility permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility\n- The app will prompt you to grant permissions on first run\n\n### Linux\n- **X11 only**: Currently only supports X11, not Wayland\n- If you're on Wayland, you'll need to switch to X11 or wait for Wayland support\n- Many modern distributions (GNOME, KDE Plasma 6+) use Wayland by default\n- To check your display server: `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`\n\n## Current Status\n\nThe app is functional with automatic tracking, database storage, and UI for managing categories, regex rules, and skipped apps. Cross-platform support is implemented with platform-specific foreground app detection.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll help is welcome—issues, PRs, questions. No strict rules yet; guidelines will be added as needed. If you're unsure, open an issue first.\n\n## License\n\nPolyform Noncommercial 1.0. For commercial use, open an issue.\n"
